    "2. **System instructions -** Be specific with your system prompt about the role you need you bot to play\n",

I'm excited to hear about your project. Could you tell me a bit about your business and what you're looking for in your new website?\\n\\n**Client:** Sure. I run a boutique travel agency that specializes in custom, luxury travel packages. We cater to high-end clients who are looking for personalized experiences. The current website we have is quite outdated and doesn't really convey the level of luxury and personalization we offer. I want something that feels more modern, elegant, and user-friendly.\\n\\n**Web Developer:** That sounds like an exciting project. To get a better understanding, can you describe some specific features or elements you want on the new site?\\n\\n**Client:** Absolutely. First off, I want a visually stunning homepage with high-quality images that immediately showcase the type of experiences we offer. It should have a sophisticated design, maybe with some subtle animations. We also need a section where clients can see sample itineraries, read about different destinations, and learn about our services.\\n\\n**Web Developer:** Great. So a strong visual appeal with high-quality imagery and animations. For the itineraries and destinations, are you thinking of a blog-style layout, or something more structured like a directory?\\n\\n**Client:** I think a structured directory would work better for us. Each destination should have its own page with detailed information, images, and maybe even client testimonials. Speaking of testimonials, I want a dedicated section for those as well, where we can showcase reviews and feedback from our clients.\\n\\n**Web Developer:** Got it. A directory for destinations with detailed pages and a separate section for testimonials. How about booking and inquiries? Do you want an integrated booking system, or will inquiries be handled through a contact form?\")"
